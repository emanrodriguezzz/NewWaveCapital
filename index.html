      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        Started by students with experience at top firms and clubs such as Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, and the Global Investments Committee.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are a community of ambitious and high-performing students, aspiring to lead the next generation of investment analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're pursuing investment banking, private equity, portfolio and wealth management, quantitative analysis, consulting, or simply curious about understanding financial markets — we offer a place to gain experience pitching and receive elite finance education.
      </p>
      <p>
        We welcome both Ross and Non-Ross students and encourage alternative investing methods rooted in STEM and public policy.
      </p>
      <p class="bold">We think outside the box. NOTHING is off limits.</p>

      <h2>Our Investment Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        We aim to simulate the alpha generation of a real hedge fund with a diversified and wide range of investments—offering typical lower-risk long/short positions while allowing more creative, higher-risk pitches using everything from commodities and options trading to polymarket arbitrage and AI algorithms.
